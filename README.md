# Flights-Listing


It's an android application which displays list of flights, mark favorite/unfavorite and display flight details as well. Modularized approach has been used while coding the app followed by MVVM architecture, coroutines, flow and Preferences DataStore has been used as a data storage. While developing the app solid principles have been applied and Dagger hilt has been used as dependency injection. Also domain layer, data layer and view model has been unit tested!

# Improvements
1. SharedFlow or StateFlow can be used instead of livedata in viewmodel
2. Instead of XML, JetPack compose can be used
